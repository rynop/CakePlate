/* Notes */
    * JavaScript packing only works with PHP5. If you're using PHP4 the scripts will still be merged into one file, but not packed.
    * A sample .htaccess file is included in the zip. Rename it and drop it in output dirs for improved performance.

/* Instructions */
   1. You'll need a working version of CakePHP installed. This is running on 1.3.4 stable.
   2. Download jsmin 1.1.0 or later and put it in vendors/jsmin.
   3. Download CSSTidy 1.3 or later and put the contents in vendors/csstidy.
   4. Download the plugin to /app/plugins/asset.
   5. Include the helper in any controller that will need it. Most likely you will put it in AppController so that it's available to all your controllers:
      var $helpers = array('Asset.asset');

   6. In your layout and views include Javascript files as you normally would when using the $scripts_for_layout approach:
      $javascript->link('jquery', false);

   7. Similarly include your css with the inline option set to false:
      $html->css('style', null, null, false);

   8. Then in your layout file, in the head section, instead of using $scripts_for_layout call the helper:
      echo $asset->scripts_for_layout();

/* Options */
   Options are set when including the helper.
   var $helpers = array('Asset.asset' => array('optionName' => 'optionValue'));
   
	 * debug, default: false
     Cake debug = 0  packed js/css returned.  $this->options['md5FileName']options['debug'] doesn't do anything.
     Cake debug > 0, $this->options['md5FileName']options['debug'] = false    essentially turns the helper off.  js/css not packed.  Good for debugging your js/css files.
     Cake debug > 0, $this->options['md5FileName']options['debug'] = true     packed js/css returned.  Good for debugging this helper.
		
	 * checkTs, default: false
     there is a *minimal* perfomance hit associated with looking up the filemtimes
     if you clean out your cached dir (as set below) on builds then you don't need this.

	 * md5FileName, default: false
     the packed files are named by stringing together all the individual file names
     this can generate really long names, so by setting this option to true
     the long name is md5'd, producing a resonable length file name.

	 * searchPaths, default: array()
     Additional paths for searching for css/js
     
	 * cachePaths, default: array('css' => 'ccss', 'js' => 'cjs')
     Paths for storing the compressed files, relative to your webroot
		
	 * cssCompression, default: high_compression
     default, low_compression, high_compression, highest_compression
		
	 * fixCssImg, default: false
     replace relative img paths in css files with full http://...
    
/* Tips */
   * Remember to set the inline option to false for JS and CSS in your layout if you want them to be packed with the view scripts.
   * Setting DEBUG on will cause this helper to output the scripts the same way $scripts_for_layout would, effectifly turning it off while testing.
   * If you get a JavaScript error with a packed version of a file it's most likely missing a semi-colon somewhere.
   * Order is important. If you include script1 then script2 on one view and script2 then script1 on another, they will generate separate packed versions and will be treated by the browser as separate scripts.
