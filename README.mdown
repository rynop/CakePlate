# CakePlate

CakePlate is a best practice template for CakePHP based web applications, inspired by http://html5boilerplate.com.  It is a mashup of lots of open source projects and snippets - so a majority of the credit should not go to us. 

**NOTE** CakePlate is no way associated with the Cake Software Foundation, or CakePHP.  We love CakePHP and are merely trying to spread the love and make peoples lives easier by saving them time. 

We only include open source code that we have personally used, and know works.
